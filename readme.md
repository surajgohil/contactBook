This is a simple ContactBook application developed using CodeIgniter 3, which allows users to manage their contacts and groups. The app provides functionality to:

Add, Update, and Delete Contacts: Users can easily manage their contact information.
Create, Update, and Delete Groups: Create groups to categorize contacts for better organization.
Move Contacts Between Groups: Transfer contacts between different groups while ensuring the contacts remain updated.
The application is built using the MVC architecture, with a focus on ease of use and functionality. It is a great starting point for building more complex contact management systems.
